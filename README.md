# CMS-Wiki

A dynamic internal Wiki configured with a headless configuration management system so that people are able to change the wiki contents or add pages whenever they want.
Storage of media files is stored to an Amazon Web Service S3 while all the rest of data is stored on sql database in Microsoft Azure Cloud.
Added a git ignore on the environment variables to my cloud settings.
